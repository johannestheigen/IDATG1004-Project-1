# IDATG1004-Project-1

The first group assignment by **Group 9** in the Team-Based Interaction (IDATG1004) course at NTNU. 

Using the LEGO EV3 development kit, the purpose of this project is to mainly learn how to work as a team, while also being introduced to creating both simple and advanced EV3 robots programmed in Visual Studio.

The project is divided into smaller exercises (1 - 4), each presenting its own unique challenges, where both the design and program evolve significantly with each exercise.
